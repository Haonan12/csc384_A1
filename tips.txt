# 1. For my original heuristic, I design to let the snowball avoid the corner and walls(if the destinationis
# not locate on that wall) by adding infinity cost
#
# 2. I also ask the snowball avoid the corner made by obstacle and obstacle/wall by adding infinity cost.
#
# 3. The cost for each unit of distance between robots and snowball is (s: 0.3, m: 0.7, b:1.1), which encourage
# the robots to approch the big ball even move away from both small and meduim ball
#
# 4. The cost for each unit of distance between destination and snowball is (s: 1.0, m: 1.1, b:1.2). The robots
# will push lager ball first.
#
# 5. The ball which have arrive to the destination in correct order will reduce the cost to 0 and the robots
# won't move it again.
